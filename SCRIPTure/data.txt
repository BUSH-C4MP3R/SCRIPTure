These creatures of the darkness come down from the mountain,
Hunting for prey,
For they need to feed I hear them growling,
Scratching at the door,
With their powerful legs they chase you till death,
And a powerful jaw crushes your bones,
Fangs and claws drip with a poison touch,
They hide in the darkness,
Ebony fur As black as night,
Eyes as Red as fire,
They lurk the streets,
And stalk the lost But then dawn breaks and the sun rises,
They bound to the distance, back to the caves.
